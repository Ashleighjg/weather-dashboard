# weather-dashboard


## Description


I was motivated to create this weather dashboard as part of my bootcamp week 6 challenge. This wesite was built to allow a user to track the current weather and the future weather. I was able to make a responsive website that allows the user to search any city in the United States and see the weather for that city.

## Usage


This website can be used by anyone that wants to find the weather in a US town or city.

 Once the user has entered the city and state into the form, the data is stored in local storage and then the user is able to view the weather information.
